                    <p class="text-muted">The query model is continuously updated to contain a certain representation of
                        the current state (state view), based on the events. This way, every feature in the workflow has
                        its own view (own table, own DB schema, ...). This is <b>CQRS pattern</b>.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">CQRS enables/unlocks <b>Event Sourcing pattern</b>. Event Sourcing mandates
                        that the state change of the application isn't explicitly stored in the database as the new
                        state (overwriting the previous state) but as a series of events. This way you don't loose any
                        data/information. Everything that happened in the system is stored.</p>
